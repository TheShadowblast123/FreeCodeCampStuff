          <p class="description">How you learn, of course, is very important as learning with an inferior method will leave you dazed and confused when it comes time to build out a project, but what if you learned by doing? This is the method employed at FreeCodeCamp and it works wonders. Instead of learning through courses that are entirely unrelated to anything you'd do in the real world, work on projects that emulate what could happen at a theoretical job. </p>
