                        <p><i>
                            A Haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry consisting of three lines. 
                            It is known for its brevity and concise nature. 
                            The format of a Haiku typically follows a specific structure: 
                            the first line contains five syllables, 
                            the second line contains seven syllables, 
                            and the third line contains five syllables again, for a total of 17. 
                            The concise structure and precise language of a Haiku allow for a powerful expression within a limited space.
